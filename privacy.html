We encourage you to read this Policy carefully.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Any updates or modifications to this Policy will be posted to our Website on this page. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our Services are operated in the United States but can be accessed worldwide. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, please consult the sections of this policy relating to the “Rights of EEA Data Subjects” and “International Data Transfers” for provisions that may apply to them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>California residents should consult the section titled “Your California Privacy Rights” for rights that apply to them.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h5>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h5>
    <br>
    <p><i>Types of Information</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>We may collect the following types of Information through our Services:

    <br>(1) “Personal Data” such as your name, e-mail address and phone number, account or mailing address, and other information that can be used to directly identify and contact you (which, in some cases, may include certain Device Information or information from the signature block of your e-mail);<br>

    <br>(2) “Device Information” which is information relating to the computer or device you are using when you access our Services, such as your computer’s IP address, your mobile device identifiers (including Apple IDFA or an Android Advertising ID), the type of browser and operating system you are using, the identity of your internet service provider, and your device and browser settings.<br>

    <br>(3) “Usage Data” which is data related to your use of the Services such as the pages you visit, the sites you use before or after visiting ours, your actions within the Services, the type of content or advertisements you have accessed, seen, forwarded and/or clicked on, Wi-Fi connections, date and time stamps, log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.<br>

    <br>As described in more detail below, we collect Personal Data only when you provide it to us but may collect other types of Information whenever you use our Services through automated means such as software developer kits, cookies and web beacons (which are discussed in more detail below).</p>

    <br><i>Personal Data</i>

    <p>You may enter the Website and browse its content without submitting any Personal Data. However, we will need to collect relevant Personal Data to provide you with certain services offered by the Services, including if you choose to create an account on our website, contact us or otherwise communicate with us in any way, subscribe or opt in to our newsletter, alerts, or other communications, subscribe or opt in to SMS messages, sign up for product waitlists, participate in a contest or promotion, order our products, submit product reviews, questions, feedback or user comments, complete an optional survey, contact customer service or otherwise interact with the Services.</p>

    <p>We use the Personal Data that we collect to respond to your requests, communicate with you regarding the Services and our content, send you promotional or marketing communications, guard against potential fraud, provide product information, service your requests and orders, and provide you with the applicable services, features or functionality associated with your submission. When you submit Personal Data through the Services, whether by directly providing it to us upon request or voluntarily disclosing it through comments, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <br><i>Device Information & Usage Data</i>

    <p>Whether or not you submit Personal Data, any time you visit our Services, we or our service providers may collect, store or accumulate certain Device Information and Usage Data. This Information may be used in furtherance of the purposes described above with respect to Personal Data and in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as optimizing the Services, evaluating the popularity of content, generating statistics and developing marketing plans, and otherwise for general administrative, analytical, research, optimization, and security purposes.</p>

    <br><i>Information to and from Social Networks</i>

    <p>We may provide functionality that will allow you to connect to our Services through a third-party social network such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (each, a “Social Network”). If you connect through a Social Network, we may collect Personal Data from your profile, such as your name, username, and e-mail address, and we will use that Personal Data for the purposes set forth herein. In addition, our Services may offer social sharing features which will allow you to “Share” or “Like” on a Social Network. If you decide to use such features, it may allow the sharing and collection of Information both to and from such Social Network, so you should check the privacy policy of each Social Network before using such features.</p>

    <br><br><h5>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h5>

    <p>In no event will we disclose, rent, sell or share any of your Personal Data to third parties for direct marketing purposes. We only share your Information with third parties for the purposes described below.</p>


    <p>We contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Services, including content streaming, email and hosting services, software development, data management, orders, payment processing, management of forms, quizzes and polls, customer service, returns, live chat, marketing, fraud prevention, product review and questions, and administration of contests and other promotions. We call them our “Service Providers.” We may share your Information with Service Providers as appropriate for them to perform their services for us and our Service Providers are permitted to use your Information only for such purposes. </p>

    <p>The server automatically logs the IP address you use to access our website as well as other information about your visit such as the pages accessed, information requested, the date and time of the request, the source of your access to our website (e.g. the website or URL (link) which referred you to our website), and your browser version and operating system.</p>

    <p>In certain instances, as with Paypal and Afterpay, which process payments, you may also be directed to a third-party website which is governed by its own privacy policy:</p>

    <br><br>https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full
    <br><br>https://www.afterpay.com/privacy-policy

    <p>We may also share or transfer Device Information and Usage Data in aggregated, anonymized form with or to our affiliates, licensees, partners and Service Providers for administrative, analytical, research, optimization, and security purposes, but no such Information will be linked with your Personal Data or be used to identify or contact you.</p>

    <p>Finally, we may share your Information: (i) In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us; (ii) When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms of Use and other agreements; or (iii) In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>

    <br><br><h5>AUTOMATED DATA COLLECTION / COOKIES</h5>



    <br><p>We may use certain automatic analytics and tracking technologies to assist us in performing a variety of functions, including storing your Information, collecting Device Information and Usage Data, understanding your use of the Services and customizing the content offered to you on the Services. We may use platforms like Google Analytics to provide aggregated or anonymized information relating to demographics, geography, interests or affinities. Other technologies we may use include:</p>

    <p>(1) Cookies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the Services and the content, offerings, or advertisements you see on the Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on the Services or remember any settings you have chosen. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. However, not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Services unavailable to you.</p>

    <p>(2) Web Beacons. We may also use "web beacons" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).</p>

    <p>(3) Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers or app developer platforms that use, mobile Software Development Kits ("SDKs") that are incorporated into the Services to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), geolocation information, and other information about your device or use of the Services. A mobile SDK may act as the mobile version of a web beacon (see "Web Beacons" above).</p>

    <p>By visiting the Services, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Services through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you. Please note that no such tracking technologies will collect any Personal Data from you unless you choose to submit it to us and that data relating to you individually is not shared with any third parties.</p>

    <p>For more information about our cookie policy, click here.</p>





    <br><br><h5>PERSONAL DATA RETENTION</h5>



    <p>We retain the Personal Data we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use the Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p>





    <br><br><h5>PRIVACY AND SECURITY</h5>



    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect our customers' Personal Data against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Information that you transmit to us or from us, and you do so at your own risk. You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.</p>

    <p>If you believe your Personal Data is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at subreefofficial@gmail.com.</p>





    <br><br><h5>USE OF AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING AND PROFILING</h5>



    <p>Except to the extent personal data is used by third-party ad networks for online behavioral advertising, neither we, nor service providers on our behalf, engage in profiling or automated decision making activities that produce legal and/or similarly significant effects upon you.</p>





    <br><br><h5>CHILDEN UNDER 16</h5>



    <p>Children under 16 years of age are not permitted to use the Services. We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data directly from anyone under the age of 16.

In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age and you believe your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at subreefofficial@gmail.com.</p>





    <br><br><h5>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS</h5>



    <p>Our Services or communications may contain links to third party websites, over which we exercise no control, including the form of embedded content, sponsored content or co-branded content. Except as set forth in this Policy, we do not share your Personal Data with those third parties and are not responsible for the privacy policies of any third party or their management of your Personal Data. Because they may treat your Information differently than we do, we suggest you read the privacy policies on those third-party websites prior to submitting any Personal Data to such sites.</p>

    <p>In addition, you may be redirected to a third-party platform for certain functions, including returns, forms, and customer service. See above section regarding “Sharing of Information.”</p>

In addition, as described in the section captioned “Your Rights” in the Privacy Policy, it is possible to change your browser settings to block the automatic collection of certain information.</p>



     <br><br><u>III. SUBMITTING A VERIFIED CONSUMER REQUEST</u>

    <p>To exercise your Right to Know, Data Portability, and Right to Delete, you must provide us with sufficient information to allow us to verify your identity, and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Once we receive the information you provide to us, we will review it and determine if more information is necessary to verify your identity as required by law, and we may request additional information in order to do so.</p>

    <p>To exercise your California privacy rights described above, please submit a verifiable request to us by:</p>

    <p>Emailing us at subreefofficial@gmail.com.</p>

    <p>Only you, or a person authorized by you to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information.</p>

    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for Right to Know or Data Portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

    <p>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative. We will need to verify your identity with at least two (2) pieces of information, such as name and email address.<br>
    Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>

    <p>We may deny your request if we are unable to verify your identity or have reason to believe that the request is fraudulent.</p>



    <br><br><h5>Consumer Request by an Authorized Agent</h5>

    <p>If any authorized agent submits a consumer request on your behalf, in order to confirm that person or entity’s authority to act on your behalf and verify the authorized agent’s identity, we require the below items:</p>

    <p>To verify your authorization to request on behalf of a California resident, provide one or more of the following: (1) California Secretary of State authorization, (2) written permission from the California resident, or (3) power of attorney.<br>
    Sufficient information to verify the authorized agent’s identity, depending on the nature of the request.<br>
    To verify the identity of the California resident for whom the request is being made, provide the information set forth above for verification of the consumer request.</p>

    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the request’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

    <p>We will acknowledge receipt of the request within ten (10) business days of its receipt. We will respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability requests, we will provide the responsive information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format that allows you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance.</p>

    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>



    <br><br><u>IV. SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u>

    <p>We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties for money. However, the CCPA defines “sale” broadly, and that definition could include information that we have shared with certain technology providers that provide certain services to us, including delivering advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. In the past twelve (12) months, we have “sold” (as defined under the CCPA) the following categories of Personal Information to the following categories of third parties:</p>

    <br>Category 1: Advertising Networks and Social Networks
    <br>Category 3: Advertising Networks and Social Networks
    <br>Category 4: Advertising Networks and Social Networks
    <br>Category 5: Advertising Networks and Social Networks

    <p>We “sell” (as defined under the CCPA) your Personal Information for the following business or commercial purposes:</p>

    <p>Marketing our products and services to you, including sending you promotional or marketing communications, which may include contests, promotions, and special offers for products and services.
    <br>Auditing related to a current interaction with the consumer and concurrent transactions, including, but not limited to, counting ad impressions to unique visitors, verifying positioning and quality of ad impressions.</p>

    <p>We do not and will not knowingly sell the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16 without affirmative authorization.</p>



    <br><br><u>Do Not Track</u>

    <p>We use analytics systems and providers and participate in ad networks that process Personal Information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, and these systems and providers may provide some of this information to us. We currently process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or similar mechanisms.</p>

    <p>Note, however, that you may find information about how to opt out of online behavioral advertising and/or block or reject certain tracking technologies in our Privacy Policy.</p>



    <br><br><u>V. NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE(S)</u>

    <p>From time to time, we may offer a financial incentive and/or price or service difference to our customers related to the collection of Personal Information. This Notice of Financial Incentive(s) explains the financial incentives or price or service differences that we may offer, so that you can make an informed decision on whether you would like to participate.</p>

    <p>Customers who sign up for our emails may receive a coupon code on their next purchase. You can opt-in to receive this code by providing your email address and/or phone number. You have the right to withdraw your consent to participate at any time and can do so by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our marketing communications.</p>

    <p>Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to Personal Information. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of financial incentives or price or service differences that we offer, we have valued the Personal Information collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount code or financial incentive offered, and the calculation of the value is based upon a reasonable and good-faith estimate often involving the consideration of (i) the categories of Personal Information collected (e.g., email addresses and phone numbers), (ii) the value of the discount offered, and (iii) the value of the total purchase (excluding taxes and fees). The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards.</p>
